## Prompt Notes
Specifying the 'style type' of the image changes the type of text that comes back.

- "Describe this diagram" seems to generate shorter more directly descriptive responses.
- "Describe this image" returns more general discussion as well as image description.

## TODO:

- [ ] try different prompts for alt text, captions, descriptions, etc.
- [ ] package this up into function calls that can be integrated into my image collections template
- [ ] save code chunk results to file with name based on input image
- [ ] provide some example text for guiding style (e.g. alt-text vs descriptions)
- [ ] integrate into publishing workflow on digital garden
