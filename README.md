## ASIDES

- used "# ASIDE:" for notes made during the live demos/workshop discussion
- more on prompt design: <https://ellmer.tidyverse.org/articles/prompt-design.html>

```
## -- ASIDE: what do you put into system prompt vs. user chat prompt?;
# - HW: don't know?; system prompt is "stronger" -- trunk of tree
# HW: openAI has hierarchy of prompts -- that even the system prompt underneath
# MOW: system prompt forgetten? -- HW: newer models are trying to prevent loss of system prompt

# ASIDE: new "session" each time you initialise chat object
chat <- chat_openai("You are a terse assistant.", echo = FALSE)
# ASIDE: claude > openai for R code
# ASIDE: edit initial prompt instead of long conversation
# ASIDE: order of prompts can matter, getting stuck in local optima of "not knowing"
# ASIDE: logistics of prompt engineering since one line prompts are only good for role play (e.g "pretend you are an alâ€¦

## IDEAS

- Recipe yaml
- RAG connected to my quarto phd-log
- Descriptive text generator for images

## Setup

You'll need the dev version of ellmer:

```r
#| eval: false
pak::pak("tidyverse/ellmer")
```

You'll also need to set up at least one chat provider. If you don't already have an API account (a paid subscription unfortunately doesn't count), we recommend either Claude or Gemini. Claude is cheap and good at R code, while gemini is free and good at videos. Follow the instructions below to configure one.

### Claude

1. Sign up at <https://console.anthropic.com>.
1. Load up enough credit to buy a coffee.
1. Create a key at <https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys> and copy it to the clipboard.
1. `usethis::edit_r_environ()`.
1. Add a new line containing: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY={paste}`.
1. Restart R.
1. Check that `ellmer::chat_claude()$chat("Tell me a joke")` works.

### Gemini

1. Log in to <https://aistudio.google.com> with a google account
1. Click *create API key* & copy it to the clipboard.
1. `usethis::edit_r_environ()`
1. Add a new line containing: `GOOGLE_API_KEY={paste}`
1. Restart R.
1. Check that `ellmer::chat_gemini()$chat("Tell me a joke")` works.
